# ERROR-Pages
Hello,
this repository contain two folders- 'Dropbox' and 'Pixar'.
In each folder you will find 2 files - an HTML file and a CSS file, which contain pages that are similar to the error pages of the websites with the same name.

## Dropbox
In this project I mostly copied from the existing site and thus learned and practiced working with the Devtool of the web browser.

## Pixar
This project I built myself (except for what must be copied) as I know based on what I learned in the course and from other sources of information. I wrote semantically and used Floats as I was asked.
